<!-- Add PyPI badge once published -->

A flexible Python toolkit designed to simplify interactions with various Large Language Models (LLMs), supporting features like tool usage and structured output formatting.

## Key Features

*   **Provider Agnostic (Pluggable):** Easily switch between different LLM providers (currently supports OpenAI). Designed for adding more providers.
*   **Tool Integration:** Define and register custom Python functions or class methods as tools that the LLM can call to interact with external systems or data.
*   **Structured Output:** Request responses in specific JSON formats, optionally validated using Pydantic models.
*   **Async First:** Built with `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O operations.
*   **Simplified Client:** High-level `LLMClient` manages provider instantiation, tool handling, and API calls.
*   **Configuration:** Loads API keys securely from environment variables (`.env` file supported) or direct arguments. If a key isn't found, initialization succeeds but API calls will raise `ConfigurationError`.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if developing) or install via pip (once published):**
    ```bash
    # For development:
    git clone https://github.com/carboni123/llm_factory_toolkit.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd llm_factory_toolkit

    # Or, once published to PyPI:
    # pip install llm-factory-toolkit
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Or if using pyproject.toml directly:
    # pip install .
    ```

3.  **(Optional but Recommended) Create a `.env` file:**
    In the root directory of your project *using* this toolkit, create a `.env` file to store API keys:
    ```dotenv
    # .env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    # Add other keys as needed for future providers
    ```
    The library uses `python-dotenv` to load these automatically.

## Quick Start

Here's a basic example using the OpenAI provider:

```python
import asyncio
import os
from llm_factory_toolkit import LLMClient
from llm_factory_toolkit.exceptions import LLMToolkitError

# Ensure your OPENAI_API_KEY is set in your environment or .env file. If it is
# missing, the client can still be created but any API call will raise
# `ConfigurationError`.

async def main():
    try:
        # Initialize the client for OpenAI
        # API key is loaded automatically from env/dotenv by default
        client = LLMClient(provider_type='openai', model='gpt-4o-mini')

        messages = [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in London today?"},
        ]

        print("Generating response...")
        response = await client.generate(input=messages)

        if response:
            print("\nAssistant Response:")
            print(response)
        else:
            print("\nFailed to get a response.")

    except LLMToolkitError as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load environment variables from .env if present
    # from dotenv import load_dotenv
    # load_dotenv()
    # Note: llm_factory_toolkit.__init__ already attempts to load .env from CWD

    # Check if API key is available (optional check)
    if not os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
         print("Warning: OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not found.")
         # Decide how to handle this - exit, prompt, etc.
         # exit(1) # Example: exit if key is missing

    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Reasoning Models

Reasoning-oriented models such as GPT‑5 generate hidden reasoning tokens that
can consume the entire `max_output_tokens` budget. The toolkit automatically
adds a buffer and may retry the call if those reasoning tokens exhaust the
limit, so you can reuse the same values you set for non-reasoning models.

```python
from llm_factory_toolkit import LLMClient

client = LLMClient(provider_type="openai", model="gpt-5-mini")
response, _ = await client.generate(
    input=[{"role": "user", "content": "The capital of France?"}],
    max_output_tokens=500,
)
print(response)
```

If needed, adjust the reasoning token buffer when creating the provider:

```python
client = LLMClient(
    provider_type="openai",
    model="gpt-5-mini",
    reasoning_token_buffer=512,
)
```

## Advanced Usage

This toolkit also supports:

*   **Registering custom tools:** Allow the LLM to call your Python functions (see `INTEGRATION.md`).
*   **Structured JSON/Pydantic output:** Get responses formatted according to a specific schema (see `INTEGRATION.md`).
*   **Mock tool execution:** Enable `mock_tools=True` to surface stubbed tool results without triggering side effects.

For detailed instructions on integrating this toolkit into your projects, including tool usage and structured output examples, please see **[INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md)**.

### Mocking tool execution

When showcasing the toolkit (for example, in the demo UI) you can prevent real
network calls or database writes by enabling mock mode:

```python
response, tool_payloads = await client.generate(
    input=messages,
    mock_tools=True,
)
```

Any tool registered through `ToolFactory` will return a stubbed
`ToolExecutionResult`. Class-based tools can customize this behaviour by
overriding `BaseTool.mock_execute`.

## Development & Testing

1.  **Set up a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
2.  **Install development dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[dev]" # Installs package in editable mode + dev deps (pytest)
    # Or: pip install -r requirements.txt pytest pytest-asyncio
    ```
3.  **Set Environment Variables for Tests:**
    Ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set (e.g., via export or your `.env` file) to run the integration tests against OpenAI.
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_key"
    ```
4.  **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest tests/
    ```
