P0 — Core
- Tool framework: register tools at startup, agent uses them freely during generation
- Agentic loop: iterate tool calls until the model has nothing left to call, then return final response

P1 — Unified access
- Multi-provider routing: swap between 100+ LLMs without changing application code
- Context injection: pass runtime data (user_id, db, etc.) to tools without exposing it to the model
- Content/payload separation: tool results split into LLM-facing content and app-facing payload
- Structured output: Pydantic model validation on model responses

P2 — Developer experience
- Streaming: async generator of chunks for real-time UIs
- Mock mode: test tool flows without hitting real APIs
- Nested tool calls: tools can invoke other tools via ToolRuntime
